# CompareFolders 
CompareFolders is a quick .NET application that finds the different files in each folder. It is great if you want to quickly compare the contents of each folder!

## Why would I need it? ##
Perhaps you need something light to compare your directories! Maybe you are looking to backup some files and want to know what files you have in both folders (yes! Compare Directories can look into your external drives as well!) But in any case, who wants to go into Powershell and manipulate it there?

## How do I use it? ##
Using Compare Directories is very simple. Type in the path of one folder in one of the text boxes and the other path in the other text box and the program will do the rest of the work! (P.S. You can download the .exe file in /bin/Release. You may also need to download the other files in there as well.)

## Any Limitiations? Catches? ##
Well, there could be some error messages here and there but mostly it's because the program could not find the directory. 

## What else can be done? ##
For the next release, features that could be implemented include:

1. Autocomplete text boxes
2. A dialog box where users can click the file path rather than typing the path.
3. A more interactive progress bar.
